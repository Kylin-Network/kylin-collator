//! Rust bindings to the `jemalloc` C library.
//!
//! `jemalloc` is a general purpose memory allocation, its documentation
//! can be found here:
//!
//! * [API documentation][jemalloc_docs]
//! * [Wiki][jemalloc_wiki] (design documents, presentations, profiling, debugging, tuning, ...)
//!
//! `jemalloc` exposes both a standard and a non-standard API.
//!
//! # Standard API
//!
//! The standard API includes: the [`malloc`], [`calloc`], [`realloc`], and
//! [`free`], which conform to to ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (“ISO C90”),
//! [`posix_memalign`] which conforms to conforms to POSIX.1-2016, and
//! [`aligned_alloc`].
//!
//! Note that these standard leave some details as _implementation defined_.
//! This docs document this behavior for `jemalloc`, but keep in mind that other
//! standard-conforming implementations of these functions in other allocators
//! might behave slightly different.
//!
//! # Non-Standard API
//!
//! The non-standard API includes: [`mallocx`], [`rallocx`], [`xallocx`],
//! [`sallocx`], [`dallocx`], [`sdallocx`], and [`nallocx`]. These functions all
//! have a `flags` argument that can be used to specify options. Use bitwise or
//! `|` to specify one or more of the following: [`MALLOCX_LG_ALIGN`],
//! [`MALLOCX_ALIGN`], [`MALLOCX_ZERO`], [`MALLOCX_TCACHE`],
//! [`MALLOCX_TCACHE_NONE`], and [`MALLOCX_ARENA`].
//!
//! # Environment variables
//!
//! The `MALLOC_CONF` environment variable affects the execution of the allocation functions.
//!
//! For the documentation of the [`MALLCTL` namespace visit the jemalloc
//! documenation][jemalloc_mallctl].

/// Extent lifetime management functions.
///
/// The extent_hooks_t structure comprises function pointers which are described
/// individually below. `jemalloc` uses these functions to manage extent lifetime,
/// which starts off with allocation of mapped committed memory, in the simplest
/// case followed by deallocation. However, there are performance and platform
/// reasons to retain extents for later reuse. Cleanup attempts cascade from
/// deallocation to decommit to forced purging to lazy purging, which gives the
/// extent management functions opportunities to reject the most permanent
/// cleanup operations in favor of less permanent (and often less costly)
/// operations. All operations except allocation can be universally opted out of
/// by setting the hook pointers to `NULL`, or selectively opted out of by
/// returning failure. Note that once the extent hook is set, the structure is
/// accessed directly by the associated arenas, so it must remain valid for the
/// entire lifetime of the arenas.
