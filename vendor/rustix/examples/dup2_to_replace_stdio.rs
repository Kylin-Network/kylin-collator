    // been closed and aren't being used for other purposes.

    // Use `dup2` to copy our new file descriptors over the stdio file descriptors.

    // These take their second argument as an `&OwnedFd` rather than the usual

    // descriptor, which one shouldn't be able to do with just a `BorrowedFd`.

    // We can also drop the original file descriptors now, since `dup2` creates
    // new file descriptors with independent lifetimes.

    // Now we can print to "stdout" in the usual way, and it'll go to our pipe.
    println!("hello, world!");

    // And we can read from stdin, and it'll read from our pipe. It's a little
    // silly that we connected our stdout to our own stdin, but it's just an
    // example :-).
