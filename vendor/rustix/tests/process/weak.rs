// Implementation derived from `weak` in Rust's
// library/std/src/sys/unix/weak.rs at revision
// fd0cb0cdc21dd9c06025277d772108f8d42cb25f.

//! Support for "weak linkage" to symbols on Unix
//!
//! Some I/O operations we do in libstd require newer versions of OSes but we
//! need to maintain binary compatibility with older releases for now. In order
//! to use the new functionality when available we use this module for
//! detection.
//!
//! One option to use here is weak linkage, but that is unfortunately only
//! really workable on Linux. Hence, use dlsym to get the symbol value at
//! runtime. This is also done for compatibility with older versions of glibc,
//! and to avoid creating dependencies on `GLIBC_PRIVATE` symbols. It assumes
//! that we've been dynamically linked to the library the symbol comes from,
//! but that is currently always the case for things like libpthread/libc.
//!
//! A long time ago this used weak linkage for the `__pthread_get_minstack`
//! symbol, but that caused Debian to detect an unnecessarily strict versioned
//! dependency on libc6 (#23628).

// There are a variety of `#[cfg]`s controlling which targets are involved in
// each instance of `weak!` and `syscall!`. Rather than trying to unify all of
// that, we'll just allow that some unix targets don't use this module at all.
