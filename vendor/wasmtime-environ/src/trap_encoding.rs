/// * Next is an array, of the same length as read before, of 32-bit
///   little-endian integers. These integers are offsets into the text section
///   of the compilation image.
/// * Finally is the same count number of bytes. Each of these bytes corresponds
///   to a trap code.
///
/// This section is decoded by `lookup_trap_code` below which will read the
/// section count, slice some bytes to get the various arrays, and then perform
/// a binary search on the offsets array to find the an index corresponding to
/// the pc being looked up. If found the same index in the trap array (the array
/// of bytes) is the trap code for that offset.
