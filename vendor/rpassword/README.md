[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/h7ak407y28k0ufw2?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/conradkleinespel/rpassword)

`rpassword` allows you to safely read passwords in a console application on Linux, OSX and Windows.

`rpassword` is made available free of charge. You can support its development through [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/conradkleinespel/) ðŸ’ª

## Usage

Add `rpassword` as a dependency in Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
rpassword = "5.0"
```

Use `rpassword` within your code:

```rust
extern crate rpassword;

fn main() {
    // Prompt for a password on TTY (safest but not always most practical when integrating with other tools or unit testing)
    let pass = rpassword::read_password_from_tty(Some("Password: ")).unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);
    
    // Prompt for a password on STDOUT
    let pass = rpassword::prompt_password_stdout("Password: ").unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);

    // Prompt for a password on STDERR
    let pass = rpassword::prompt_password_stderr("Password: ").unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);

    // Read a password without prompt
    let pass = rpassword::read_password().unwrap();
    println!("Your password is {}", pass);
}
```
