/// A WebAssembly linear memory.
///
/// WebAssembly memories represent a contiguous array of bytes that have a size
/// that is always a multiple of the WebAssembly page size, currently 64
/// kilobytes.
///
/// WebAssembly memory is used for global data (not to be confused with wasm
/// `global` items), statics in C/C++/Rust, shadow stack memory, etc. Accessing
/// wasm memory is generally quite fast.
///
/// Memories, like other wasm items, are owned by a [`Store`](crate::Store).
///
/// # `Memory` and Safety
///
/// Linear memory is a lynchpin of safety for WebAssembly. In Wasmtime there are
/// safe methods of interacting with a [`Memory`]:
///
/// * [`Memory::read`]
/// * [`Memory::write`]
/// * [`Memory::data`]
/// * [`Memory::data_mut`]
///
/// Note that all of these consider the entire store context as borrowed for the
/// duration of the call or the duration of the returned slice. This largely
/// means that while the function is running you'll be unable to borrow anything
/// else from the store. This includes getting access to the `T` on
/// [`Store<T>`](crate::Store), but it also means that you can't recursively
/// call into WebAssembly for instance.
///
/// If you'd like to dip your toes into handling [`Memory`] in a more raw
/// fashion (e.g. by using raw pointers or raw slices), then there's a few
/// important points to consider when doing so:
///
/// * Any recursive calls into WebAssembly can possibly modify any byte of the
///   entire memory. This means that whenever wasm is called Rust can't have any
///   long-lived borrows live across the wasm function call. Slices like `&mut
///   [u8]` will be violated because they're not actually exclusive at that
///   point, and slices like `&[u8]` are also violated because their contents
///   may be mutated.
///
/// * WebAssembly memories can grow, and growth may change the base pointer.
///   This means that even holding a raw pointer to memory over a wasm function
///   call is also incorrect. Anywhere in the function call the base address of
///   memory may change. Note that growth can also be requested from the
///   embedding API as well.
///
/// As a general rule of thumb it's recommended to stick to the safe methods of
/// [`Memory`] if you can. It's not advised to use raw pointers or `unsafe`
/// operations because of how easy it is to accidentally get things wrong.
///
/// Some examples of safely interacting with memory are:
///
/// ```rust
/// use wasmtime::{Memory, Store, MemoryAccessError};
///
/// // Memory can be read and written safely with the `Memory::read` and
/// // `Memory::write` methods.
/// // An error is returned if the copy did not succeed.
/// fn safe_examples(mem: Memory, store: &mut Store<()>) -> Result<(), MemoryAccessError> {
///     let offset = 5;
///     mem.write(&mut *store, offset, b"hello")?;
///     let mut buffer = [0u8; 5];
///     mem.read(&store, offset, &mut buffer)?;
///     assert_eq!(b"hello", &buffer);
///
///     // Note that while this is safe care must be taken because the indexing
///     // here may panic if the memory isn't large enough.
///     assert_eq!(&mem.data(&store)[offset..offset + 5], b"hello");
///     mem.data_mut(&mut *store)[offset..offset + 5].copy_from_slice(b"bye!!");
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It's worth also, however, covering some examples of **incorrect**,
/// **unsafe** usages of `Memory`. Do not do these things!
///
/// ```rust
/// # use anyhow::Result;
/// use wasmtime::{Memory, Store};
///
/// // NOTE: All code in this function is not safe to execute and may cause
/// // segfaults/undefined behavior at runtime. Do not copy/paste these examples
/// // into production code!
/// unsafe fn unsafe_examples(mem: Memory, store: &mut Store<()>) -> Result<()> {
///     // First and foremost, any borrow can be invalidated at any time via the
///     // `Memory::grow` function. This can relocate memory which causes any
///     // previous pointer to be possibly invalid now.
///     let pointer: &u8 = &*mem.data_ptr(&store);
///     mem.grow(&mut *store, 1)?; // invalidates `pointer`!
///     // println!("{}", *pointer); // FATAL: use-after-free
///
///     // Note that the use-after-free also applies to slices, whether they're
///     // slices of bytes or strings.
///     let mem_slice = std::slice::from_raw_parts(
///         mem.data_ptr(&store),
///         mem.data_size(&store),
///     );
///     let slice: &[u8] = &mem_slice[0x100..0x102];
///     mem.grow(&mut *store, 1)?; // invalidates `slice`!
///     // println!("{:?}", slice); // FATAL: use-after-free
///
///     // The `Memory` type may be stored in other locations, so if you hand
///     // off access to the `Store` then those locations may also call
///     // `Memory::grow` or similar, so it's not enough to just audit code for
///     // calls to `Memory::grow`.
///     let pointer: &u8 = &*mem.data_ptr(&store);
///     some_other_function(store); // may invalidate `pointer` through use of `store`
///     // println!("{:?}", pointer); // FATAL: maybe a use-after-free
///
///     // An especially subtle aspect of accessing a wasm instance's memory is
///     // that you need to be extremely careful about aliasing. Anyone at any
///     // time can call `data_unchecked()` or `data_unchecked_mut()`, which
///     // means you can easily have aliasing mutable references:
///     let ref1: &u8 = &*mem.data_ptr(&store).add(0x100);
///     let ref2: &mut u8 = &mut *mem.data_ptr(&store).add(0x100);
///     // *ref2 = *ref1; // FATAL: violates Rust's aliasing rules
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// # fn some_other_function(store: &mut Store<()>) {}
/// ```
///
/// Overall there's some general rules of thumb when unsafely working with
/// `Memory` and getting raw pointers inside of it:
///
/// * If you never have a "long lived" pointer into memory, you're likely in the
///   clear. Care still needs to be taken in threaded scenarios or when/where
///   data is read, but you'll be shielded from many classes of issues.
/// * Long-lived pointers must always respect Rust'a aliasing rules. It's ok for
///   shared borrows to overlap with each other, but mutable borrows must
///   overlap with nothing.
/// * Long-lived pointers are only valid if they're not invalidated for their
///   lifetime. This means that [`Store`](crate::Store) isn't used to reenter
///   wasm or the memory itself is never grown or otherwise modified/aliased.
///
/// At this point it's worth reiterating again that unsafely working with
/// `Memory` is pretty tricky and not recommended! It's highly recommended to
/// use the safe methods to interact with [`Memory`] whenever possible.
///
/// ## `Memory` Safety and Threads
///
/// Currently the `wasmtime` crate does not implement the wasm threads proposal,
/// but it is planned to do so. It may be interesting to readers to see how this
/// affects memory safety and what was previously just discussed as well.
///
/// Once threads are added into the mix, all of the above rules still apply.
/// There's an additional consideration that all reads and writes can happen
/// concurrently, though. This effectively means that any borrow into wasm
/// memory are virtually never safe to have.
///
/// Mutable pointers are fundamentally unsafe to have in a concurrent scenario
/// in the face of arbitrary wasm code. Only if you dynamically know for sure
/// that wasm won't access a region would it be safe to construct a mutable
/// pointer. Additionally even shared pointers are largely unsafe because their
/// underlying contents may change, so unless `UnsafeCell` in one form or
/// another is used everywhere there's no safety.
///
/// One important point about concurrency is that while [`Memory::grow`] can
/// happen concurrently it will never relocate the base pointer. Shared
/// memories must always have a maximum size and they will be preallocated such
/// that growth will never relocate the base pointer. The current size of the
/// memory may still change over time though.
///
/// Overall the general rule of thumb for shared memories is that you must
/// atomically read and write everything. Nothing can be borrowed and everything
/// must be eagerly copied out. This means that [`Memory::data`] and
/// [`Memory::data_mut`] won't work in the future (they'll probably return an
/// error) for shared memories when they're implemented. When possible it's
/// recommended to use [`Memory::read`] and [`Memory::write`] which will still
/// be provided.
