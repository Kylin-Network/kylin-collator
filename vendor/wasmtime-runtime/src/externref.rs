//! # `VMExternRef`
//!
//! `VMExternRef` is a reference-counted box for any kind of data that is
//! external and opaque to running Wasm. Sometimes it might hold a Wasmtime
//! thing, other times it might hold something from a Wasmtime embedder and is
//! opaque even to us. It is morally equivalent to `Rc<dyn Any>` in Rust, but
//! additionally always fits in a pointer-sized word. `VMExternRef` is
//! non-nullable, but `Option<VMExternRef>` is a null pointer.
//!
//! The one part of `VMExternRef` that can't ever be opaque to us is the
//! reference count. Even when we don't know what's inside an `VMExternRef`, we
//! need to be able to manipulate its reference count as we add and remove
//! references to it. And we need to do this from compiled Wasm code, so it must
//! be `repr(C)`!
//!
//! ## Memory Layout
//!
//! `VMExternRef` itself is just a pointer to an `VMExternData`, which holds the
//! opaque, boxed value, its reference count, and its vtable pointer.
//!
//! The `VMExternData` struct is *preceded* by the dynamically-sized value boxed
//! up and referenced by one or more `VMExternRef`s:
//!
//! ```text
//!      ,-------------------------------------------------------.
//!      |                                                       |
//!      V                                                       |
//!     +----------------------------+-----------+-----------+   |
//!     | dynamically-sized value... | ref_count | value_ptr |---'
//!     +----------------------------+-----------+-----------+
//!                                  | VMExternData          |
//!                                  +-----------------------+
//!                                   ^
//! +-------------+                   |
//! | VMExternRef |-------------------+
//! +-------------+                   |
//!                                   |
//! +-------------+                   |
//! | VMExternRef |-------------------+
//! +-------------+                   |
//!                                   |
//!   ...                            ===
//!                                   |
//! +-------------+                   |
//! | VMExternRef |-------------------'
//! +-------------+
//! ```
//!
//! The `value_ptr` member always points backwards to the start of the
//! dynamically-sized value (which is also the start of the heap allocation for
//! this value-and-`VMExternData` pair). Because it is a `dyn` pointer, it is
//! fat, and also points to the value's `Any` vtable.
//!
//! The boxed value and the `VMExternRef` footer are held a single heap
//! allocation. The layout described above is used to make satisfying the
//! value's alignment easy: we just need to ensure that the heap allocation used
//! to hold everything satisfies its alignment. It also ensures that we don't
//! need a ton of excess padding between the `VMExternData` and the value for
//! values with large alignment.
//!
//! ## Reference Counting, Wasm Functions, and Garbage Collection
//!
//! For host VM code, we use plain reference counting, where cloning increments
//! the reference count, and dropping decrements it. We can avoid many of the
//! on-stack increment/decrement operations that typically plague the
//! performance of reference counting via Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
//! Moving a `VMExternRef` avoids mutating its reference count, and borrowing it
//! either avoids the reference count increment or delays it until if/when the
//! `VMExternRef` is cloned.
//!
//! When passing a `VMExternRef` into compiled Wasm code, we don't want to do
//! reference count mutations for every compiled `local.{get,set}`, nor for
//! every function call. Therefore, we use a variation of **deferred reference
//! counting**, where we only mutate reference counts when storing
//! `VMExternRef`s somewhere that outlives the activation: into a global or
//! table. Simultaneously, we over-approximate the set of `VMExternRef`s that
//! are inside Wasm function activations. Periodically, we walk the stack at GC
//! safe points, and use stack map information to precisely identify the set of
//! `VMExternRef`s inside Wasm activations. Then we take the difference between
//! this precise set and our over-approximation, and decrement the reference
//! count for each of the `VMExternRef`s that are in our over-approximation but
//! not in the precise set. Finally, the over-approximation is replaced with the
//! precise set.
//!
//! The `VMExternRefActivationsTable` implements the over-approximized set of
//! `VMExternRef`s referenced by Wasm activations. Calling a Wasm function and
//! passing it a `VMExternRef` moves the `VMExternRef` into the table, and the
//! compiled Wasm function logically "borrows" the `VMExternRef` from the
//! table. Similarly, `global.get` and `table.get` operations clone the gotten
//! `VMExternRef` into the `VMExternRefActivationsTable` and then "borrow" the
//! reference out of the table.
//!
//! When a `VMExternRef` is returned to host code from a Wasm function, the host
//! increments the reference count (because the reference is logically
//! "borrowed" from the `VMExternRefActivationsTable` and the reference count
//! from the table will be dropped at the next GC).
//!
//! For more general information on deferred reference counting, see *An
//! Examination of Deferred Reference Counting and Cycle Detection* by Quinane:
//! <https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/42030/2/hon-thesis.pdf>

/// Unlike the `externref` in the Wasm spec, `VMExternRef`s are non-nullable,

///
/// `VMExternRef`s are reference counted, so cloning is a cheap, shallow

/// mutable, exclusive reference to their inner contents, only a shared,
/// immutable reference. You may use interior mutability with `RefCell` or
/// `Mutex` to work around this restriction, if necessary.
///
/// `VMExternRef`s have pointer-equality semantics, not structural-equality
/// semantics. Given two `VMExternRef`s `a` and `b`, `a == b` only if `a` and
/// `b` point to the same allocation. `a` and `b` are considered not equal, even
/// if `a` and `b` are two different identical copies of the same data, if they
/// are in two different allocations. The hashing and ordering implementations
/// also only operate on the pointer.
