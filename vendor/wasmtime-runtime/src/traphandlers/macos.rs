//! macOS-specific handling of handling exceptions
//!
//! Unlike other Unix platforms macOS here uses mach ports to handle exceptions
//! instead of signals. While macOS platforms could use signals (and
//! historically they did!) this is incompatible when Wasmtime is linked into a
//! project that is otherwise using mach ports for catching exceptions. This
//! came up #2456 notably when a project like Breakpad is integrated to blanket
//! catch exceptions and report them.
//!
//! Mach ports are somewhat obscure and not really heavily used in a ton of
//! places. Needless to say the original author of this file worked with mach
//! ports for the first time when writing this file. As such the exact specifics
//! here may not be super well documented. This file is 100% lifted from
//! SpiderMonkey and then adapted for Wasmtime's purposes. Credit for almost
//! all of this file goes to SpiderMonkey for figuring out all the fiddly bits.
//! See also
//! <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp>
//! for the original code.
//!
//! The high-level overview is that when using mach ports a thread is blocked
//! when it generates an exception and then a message can be read from the
//! port. This means that, unlike signals, threads can't fix their own traps.
//! Instead a helper thread is spun up to service exception messages. This is
//! also in conflict with Wasmtime's exception handling currently which is to
//! use a thread-local to store information about how to unwind. Additionally
//! this requires that the check of whether a pc is a wasm trap or not is a
//! global check rather than a per-thread check. This necessitates the existence
//! of `GlobalModuleRegistry` in the `wasmtime` crate.
//!
//! Otherwise this file heavily uses the `mach` Rust crate for type and
//! function declarations. Many bits and pieces are copied or translated from
//! the SpiderMonkey implementation and it should pass all the tests!
