//! From libsecp256k1:
//!
//! The Secp256k1 curve has an endomorphism, where lambda * (x, y) = (beta * x, y), where
//! lambda is {0x53,0x63,0xad,0x4c,0xc0,0x5c,0x30,0xe0,0xa5,0x26,0x1c,0x02,0x88,0x12,0x64,0x5a,
//!         0x12,0x2e,0x22,0xea,0x20,0x81,0x66,0x78,0xdf,0x02,0x96,0x7c,0x1b,0x23,0xbd,0x72}
//!
//! "Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography" (Hankerson, Menezes, Vanstone) gives an algorithm
//! (algorithm 3.74) to find k1 and k2 given k, such that k1 + k2 * lambda == k mod n, and k1
//! and k2 have a small size.
//! It relies on constants a1, b1, a2, b2. These constants for the value of lambda above are:
//!
//! - a1 =      {0x30,0x86,0xd2,0x21,0xa7,0xd4,0x6b,0xcd,0xe8,0x6c,0x90,0xe4,0x92,0x84,0xeb,0x15}
//! - b1 =     -{0xe4,0x43,0x7e,0xd6,0x01,0x0e,0x88,0x28,0x6f,0x54,0x7f,0xa9,0x0a,0xbf,0xe4,0xc3}
//! - a2 = {0x01,0x14,0xca,0x50,0xf7,0xa8,0xe2,0xf3,0xf6,0x57,0xc1,0x10,0x8d,0x9d,0x44,0xcf,0xd8}
//! - b2 =      {0x30,0x86,0xd2,0x21,0xa7,0xd4,0x6b,0xcd,0xe8,0x6c,0x90,0xe4,0x92,0x84,0xeb,0x15}
//!
//! The algorithm then computes c1 = round(b1 * k / n) and c2 = round(b2 * k / n), and gives
//! k1 = k - (c1*a1 + c2*a2) and k2 = -(c1*b1 + c2*b2). Instead, we use modular arithmetic, and
//! compute k1 as k - k2 * lambda, avoiding the need for constants a1 and a2.
//!
//! g1, g2 are precomputed constants used to replace division with a rounded multiplication
//! when decomposing the scalar for an endomorphism-based point multiplication.
//!
//! The possibility of using precomputed estimates is mentioned in "Guide to Elliptic Curve
//! Cryptography" (Hankerson, Menezes, Vanstone) in section 3.5.
//!
//! The derivation is described in the paper "Efficient Software Implementation of Public-Key
//! Cryptography on Sensor Networks Using the MSP430X Microcontroller" (Gouvea, Oliveira, Lopez),
//! Section 4.3 (here we use a somewhat higher-precision estimate):
//! d = a1*b2 - b1*a2
//! g1 = round((2^272)*b2/d)
//! g2 = round((2^272)*b1/d)
//!
//! (Note that 'd' is also equal to the curve order here because `[a1,b1]` and `[a2,b2]` are found
//! as outputs of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm on inputs 'order' and 'lambda').
//!
//! @fjarri:
//!
//! To be precise, the method used here is based on "An Alternate Decomposition of an Integer for
//! Faster Point Multiplication on Certain Elliptic Curves" by Young-Ho Park, Sangtae Jeong,
//! Chang Han Kim, and Jongin Lim:
//! <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-45664-3_23>
//!
//! The precision used for `g1` and `g2` is not enough to ensure correct approximation at all times.
//! For example, `2^272 * b1 / n` used to calculate `g2` is rounded down.
//! This means that the approximation `z' = k * g2 / 2^272` always slightly underestimates
//! the real value `z = b1 * k / n`. Therefore, when the fractional part of `z` is just slightly
//! above 0.5, it will be rounded up, but `z'` will have the fractional part slightly below 0.5 and
//! will be rounded down.
//!
//! The difference `z - z' = k * delta / 2^272`, where `delta = b1 * 2^272 mod n`.
//! The closest `z` can get to the fractional part equal to .5 is `1 / (2n)` (since `n` is odd).
//! Therefore, to guarantee that `z'` will always be rounded to the same value, one must have
//! `delta / 2^m < 1 / (2n * (n - 1))`, where `m` is the power of 2 used for the approximation.
//! This means that one should use at least `m = 512` (since `0 < delta < 1`).
//! Indeed, tests show that with only `m = 272` the approximation produces off-by-1 errors
//! occasionally.
//!
//! Now since `r1` is calculated as `k - r2 * lambda mod n`, the contract
//! `r1 + r2 * lambda = k mod n` is always satisfied. The method guarantees both `r1` and `r2` to be
//! less than `sqrt(n)` (so, fit in 128 bits) if the rounding is applied correctly - but in our case
//! the off-by-1 errors will produce different `r1` and `r2` which are not necessarily bounded by
//! `sqrt(n)`.
//!
//! In experiments, I was not able to detect any case where they would go outside the 128 bit bound,
//! but I cannot be sure that it cannot happen.
