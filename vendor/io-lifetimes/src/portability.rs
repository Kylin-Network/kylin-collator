//! Portability abstractions over `Owned*` and `Borrowed*`.
//!
//! On Unix, "everything is a file descriptor". On Windows, file/pipe/process
//! handles are distinct from socket descriptors. This file provides a minimal
//! layer of portability over this difference.
//!
//! TODO: Should this layer be folded into types.rs/traits.rs?
